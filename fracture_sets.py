class StochasticFractureNetwork2d(pp.FractureNetwork2d):
    """ Mother class for the stochastic fracture network generators.

    The class is implemented as an extension of the standard class for representation of
    2d fracture networks in PorePy.

    The main intended usage is to fit statistical distributions to the fractures,
    and use this to generate realizations based on this statistics. The statistical
    properties of the fracture set is characterized in terms of fracture position,
    length and angle.

    It is assumed that the fractures can meaningfully be represented by a single
    statistical distribution. To achieve this, it may be necessary to divide a
    fracture network into several sets, and fit them separately. As an example,
    a network where the fractures have one out of two orientations which are orthogonal
    to each other will not be meaningfully be represented as a single set.

    Attributes:
        pts (np.array, 2 x num_pts): Start and endpoints of the fractures. Points
            can be shared by fractures.
        edges (np.array, (2 + num_tags) x num_fracs): The first two rows represent
            indices, refering to pts, of the start and end points of the fractures.
            Additional rows are optional tags of the fractures.
        domain (dictionary): The domain in which the fracture set is defined.
            Should contain keys 'xmin', 'xmax', 'ymin', 'ymax', each of which
            maps to a double giving the range of the domain. The fractures need
            not lay inside the domain.
        num_frac (int): Number of fractures in the domain.

            dist_angle: Statistical distribution of orientations. Should be a dictionary

                scipy.stats.distribution, or another object with a function

        """ TECHNICAL COMMENT, TO BE PRESERVED FOR NOW
        Update: The algorithm above will find the intersection points between
        rays from endpoints of other fractures, but it cannot find all
        pairs of potential visibility combinations. For this, use a divide and
        conquer (like?) algorithm: Sort all intersection points from other fractures
        on the central line. Start on one end of the fracture, the ray from that
        point will

        for each fracture as main:

            if the ray hits another fracture, initialize the visibility branches
                with this pair
            else:
                visibility branch is empty, there are no active others

            while there are more intersection points (spatially sorted) with rays from other fractures
                Check whether the other fracture has been found before (it is active)
                if yes,
                    deactivate the other fracture,
                    mark this interval as a pairing between the main and other fracture
                    find the fracture on the other side of the other fracture - this is the new active one
                if not - we are meeting a new active fracture
                    mark the interval behind us as a pairing of the new and (old) active fracture
                    update index to new fracture

            To avoid double accounting of pairs, only add to global list if the
            main fracture has the lower index.
            If two fractures have multiple common intervals, store this as separate
            visibility branches

            Data structure necessary: All fractures must have access to intersection
            points from other fractures.
            When deactivating a fracture, it should be easy to find the one on the
            other side.


        NOTE: To handle intersections of other fractures, we need to work on
        branches, not full fractures.
